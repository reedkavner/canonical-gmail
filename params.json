{"name":"Canonical-gmail","tagline":"","body":"canonical-gmail\r\n===============\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating the addresses of incoming mail, Gmail servers...\r\n- Are case insensitive\r\n- Ignore periods\r\n- Ignore any text after a plus sign\r\n\r\nAdditionally, and @gmail.com  @googlemail.com can be used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nSo...\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE+foo@gmail.com == example+bar@gmail.com == exam.ple@googlemail.com\r\n\r\nAll of these variables make it difficult to check a given email address for uniqueness.\r\n\r\nThis normalize(email) method in this module transforms any email address on a Gmail server to its \r\ncanonical representation  (E.g., Example.Test+foo@googlemail.com becomes exampletest@gmail.com) \r\nso that it can be compared against other canonical addresses.\r\n\r\nThe canonical address should not be stored in lieu of the user's inputed address, as some\r\nfolks use the plus sign \"hack\" to route their incoming email to particular folders. These\r\nGmail power users can be a persnickety bunch. Don't mess up their system.\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCY: https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython (or 'pip install dnspython')\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
